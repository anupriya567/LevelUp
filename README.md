# LevelUp
A blog made with Django, Bootstrap, Html and Css. 
It contains the links of free resources to learn and practice skills like Data Structures & Algorithms, Developments and many more technical skills.

Gives a great insite about following:
1) Why use Media Directory when we are already making a static one?
   Creating a media directory in the root project directory of your website.
   Django wants you to have 2 directories on your website for static files, such as images and videos.
   One directory is the static directory. This directory holds static files that you, as the webmaster, put on your site.
   The other directory is the media directory. This directory holds static files that an outside user (not the webmaster) uploads to the site.
   Django differentiates the 2 for organization as well as probably for security reasons. Being that you don't really know what a user uploads to a site, it should contained in a    separate directory.
